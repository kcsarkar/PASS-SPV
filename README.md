This is the PASS version of the Solar position view. This piece of code is a small modification from PASS-EOV version and projects the sky as we would see from the Solar location. It can be useful to project large structures in our Galaxy. The uploaded version was applied to get a multiwavelength maps of the Fermi Bubbles, North Polar Spur, Loop-I etc. In this case, the map is projected on the Galactic longitude and latitude plane.

Although this version has been modified from the PASS-EOV, many customisations have been done for the particular case that I was studying. For a general view of the code, the readers are requested to look at the PASS-EOV version.
